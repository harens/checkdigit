"""Cyclic Redundancy Check.

A block of binary as a form of data validation is appended to a bitstring.
This can be easily checked even by very simple circuitry,
and can also be used to correct some errors.

WARNING: THIS IS NOT A FAST IMPLEMENTATION OF CRC.

If you want a fast implementation look elsewhere.
